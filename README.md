  Each blog has its own dynamic route `/blog/:id` for individual pages.

- **Context API for State Management**  
  Uses React Context (`BlogContext`) to manage blog data and actions globally.

- **Persistent Storage**  
  Blogs are saved and loaded from `localStorage` to keep data after refresh.

- **Responsive UI**  
  Styled with DaisyUI and Tailwind CSS for a modern and responsive interface.

- **Uniform Blog Cards**  
  Blog preview cards maintain consistent width and height with scrollable previews.

- **Navigation with React Router DOM**  
  Declarative routing with nested routes and navigation between Home, Add, Edit, and View pages.
